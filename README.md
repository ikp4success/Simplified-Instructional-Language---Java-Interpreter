Read .C file and compile it to SIC/XE assembly code -used java

This was another exciting project for CIS 335, but couldn’t finish as it was given in the last weeks of the semester towards the Finals. Pseudo code gotten from the class, wasn’t helpful either as i couldn’t compile it. I used python at first, but didn't have the kind of flexibility i get with java especially when handling parenthesis, and following the Stmt- Expr- Term-Factor pseudo style code structure. Handling parenthesis was the most difficult of the program, especially when you have to create custom id for each unknown variable which i did and stored in the hashmap table. Still on parenthesis when handling it, especially in python, following the pseudo code was difficult, because sometimes the left and right term/factor can be a parenthesis. So i had to modify the code to handle parenthesis first before handling other expressions. Handling of when to print out STA or print out STA T2 was even more challenging as the example given on the assignment question wasn’t consistent with the book, but i tried to make it look like assignment question. i also found out from the the given code you have to check if T1 was created already for that unknown variable before creating a new one. The code so far works but when you have multiple parenthesis with leading signs the order is kind of messed up but it compiles it.
